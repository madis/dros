# Scripts

The helper scripts in this folders are small tools for convenience to simplify doing certain actions during development. They are like scratchpad to quickly try out things. This is why they don't have tests and can have lower code quality.

Once some of them appear more useful from application's standpoint, they will be refactored and incorporated into the application code as rake tasks or services.
